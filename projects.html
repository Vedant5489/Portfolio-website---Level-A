            <p>This is a banking management system designed in java. It simulates a basic transaction method like  UPI. 
                It uses MYSQL database for data retrieval and storage. It is built to handle single user interface over CMD,
                and the best part is that it also generates a unique transaction id of format: 'AAAAAA1234' for future reference.
